# Instructions for generating the YAML file:
# The YAML file should have two top-level keys: 'eeg_formats' and 'eeg_paradigms'.
# Under 'eeg_formats', each format should be represented as a dictionary with 'name' and 'description' keys.
# Under 'eeg_paradigms', each paradigm should be represented as a dictionary with 'name' and 'description' keys.
# Example YAML file:
# eeg_formats:
#   - name: 'EDF'
#     description: 'European Data Format'
#   - name: 'BDF'
#     description: 'Biosemi Data Format'
# eeg_paradigms:
#   - name: 'Oddball'
#     description: 'Auditory oddball paradigm'
#   - name: 'Stroop'
#     description: 'Stroop color-word interference task'
