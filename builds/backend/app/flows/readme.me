1. Import Analysis Definitions (YAML Configuration)
   - Read and parse the analysis definitions from a YAML file.
   - Validate the definitions using database naming conventions.
   - Apply database defaults to the parameters, where applicable.
   - Update the `Analysis` table by marking old analyses as inactive and adding/updating current ones.

   Output: A validated and fully updated analysis configuration.

2. Fetch Files and Active Analyses
   - Query the `WorkList` table to find files ready for analysis.
   - Retrieve active analyses from the database, ensuring they match the analysis configurations.
   - Ensure compatibility between files and analyses (e.g., EEG formats, paradigms).

   Output: A mapping of files to active analyses.

3. Schedule and Execute Analysis Tasks (Prefect Flow)
   - Use Prefect's `map` functionality to parallelize tasks.
   - Define Prefect tasks to:
     a. Load the file data.
     b. Execute the appropriate analysis function.
     c. Collect the results and status (pass/fail).
   - Organize the tasks into a Prefect flow for streamlined scheduling.

   Output: A Prefect flow that schedules analysis tasks per file.

4. Standardize and Store Analysis Results
   - Use a Prefect task to standardize the results into a consistent structure.
   - Store a summary and link to the full results in the `WorkList` table.
   - Ensure results include a high-level summary and pass/fail status.
   - Store additional detailed results in a separate table if needed.

   Output: A unified, standardized report summarizing results with detailed data.

5. Generate Interactive Report
   - Query the `WorkList` table to gather the standardized summaries.
   - Use visualization tools or frameworks to provide an interactive web-based report.
   - Provide download links or references to detailed results.

   Output: A comprehensive, interactive report showcasing analysis results.

### Overview
1. **Import and Validation:** The analysis definitions are parsed, validated, and aligned with database conventions.
2. **Analysis Scheduling:** Prefect schedules analysis tasks based on the available files and compatible analyses.
3. **Results Standardization:** Results are summarized and stored for easy retrieval and presentation.
4. **Reporting:** An interactive report presents high-level summaries and links to the full results.

This flowchart illustrates the logical steps required to ensure consistent analysis scheduling, execution, and reporting within the overall analysis system.
